The training with Task1.1 was successfully done:
======================================================
- GIT was successfully installed on a workstation with **Windows 10x64**.
- A *private* repository on github User: Shivalin has been successfully created.
- I have generated an SSH key pair and I have Added my public key to GitHub.
- The repository was cloned to the workstation, folders were created in the local repository folder according to the example from the task.
- All items of Task1.1 have been done for training purposes several times in the Gitbash emulator.
- I had problem with error when have executed command "git push origin --all" because it wasn`t good idea to execute command "git init" in the directory "/DevOps_online_Kiev_2021Q4/m1/task1.1/"
- Notepad++ was used as text editor.

This task helped me to understand the basic git commands and how git works.
Information about Markdown also turned out to be new and interesting.
