## PART 1. HYPERVISORS

### 1.What are the most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization?

* Xen
* Hyper-V
* VMware
* KVM (RHEV)

### 2.Briefly describe the main differences of the most popular hypervisors
Depending on the hypervisor, the capabilities provided by it can radically change, it is necessary to carefully consider the choice of the control basis of the virtual environment.
When comparing, the most important characteristics and capabilities of hypervisors are:

* ***scalability, infrastructure expansion***;

* ***performance indicators*** - high-speed data transmission interfaces and hard drives;

* ***resource management mechanisms*** - allowing efficient use of all available physical and virtual capacities;

* ***security*** - protection mechanisms against malicious actions;

* ***fault tolerance*** - mechanisms to restore information after various malfunctions;

* ***The number and types of supported guest operating systems***;

**A very significant parameter is Ð¡ost.**

*Freeware solutions from the above vendors are significantly more limited in functionality.*

***KVM is freeware*** (Red Hat solution RHEV is a supported commercial version of KVM)
